I have already bought the
[Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver][05]
in the hopes of hacking for something useful ($35 .... why not),
but I have been dragging my feet about getting a amateur radio license.
I then read the Hackaday article "[Sage Advice for the New Ham][03]"
and "[Get Your Amateur Radio License Already][04]".
I told myself it was time.
After a quick look at the [pool of test questions for the license exam][02],
I suspect I could pass the Technician Class, maybe even the General Class,
going in cold, without studying
(by the way, no need to learn Morse Code these day).
If you needs some additional motivation for taking the test, check out these sites:

# Baofeng UV-5R+ 136-174 400-480 MHz FM Transceiver
This is an inexpensive Chinese hand held 5 watt radio,
capable of transmitting and receiving on the 2-meter and 70-cm bands.
Additionally, it can receive on standard commercial FM frequencies as well as weather band!
I bought it because its programmability and others have successfully hacked it
Some examples of this are:

Maybe I could even do some exploring of spectrum mysteries like
[Number Stations][01] and [Tesla Spirit Radio][06]).

# History of Ham
The origin of the term "Ham" is not clear but the prevailing theory is the following.
In the early part of the 20th Century,
Radio was proving its usefulness and electronic experimenters would homebrew their own radio stations,
and begin broadcasting.
The burgeoning commercial radio broadcasters would compete head to head
for the radio crystal listening audience (themselves early adopters).
Broadcast professionals would refer to the homebrewers as "Hams"
as in bad actors.
Through the power of lobbying organizations,
the Hams of the day were relegated to one small part of radio spectrum.
In the 1920's, Hiram Percy Maxim saw the value of a public with radios transceivers for emergency communications,
and founded the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).
