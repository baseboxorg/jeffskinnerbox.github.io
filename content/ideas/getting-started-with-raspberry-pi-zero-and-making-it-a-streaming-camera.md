[!rpi-zero](http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/straightened.jpg)
the 'normal' GPIO header pins have been left off to keep the devices slim and small,
and the processor / RAM are kept pretty basic.
Instead of the RPi 2's faster quad core ARM v7,
the Zero uses a single-core 1GHz ARM
(same processor in the RPi Model B+ and A+) and has only 512 MB of RAM.
You're essentially going to get the same performance as the RPi A+ or B+.
If you're looking for something that can do some more serious processing,
check out the RPi 2 or RPi 3.

# Raspberry Pi Zero Tour
![rpi-zero](http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/victory7com/imgs/1/2/1237de17.jpg)
[Adafruit][05] gives a nice [tour of the RPi Zero][04].

* HDMI Video is still available,
but you'll to use a Mini to Standard HDMI adapter to connect an HDMI cable.
* No analog audio out,
but if you connect HDMI to a monitor with speakers you will get HDMI digital audio.
* Like the RPi Model A+,
the RPi Zero does not have a USB Hub built in.
This means you get one USB port!
Moreover that USB port is not a standard [type A port][07],
instead it is a [USB On-The-Go (USB OTG)][08] port.
* The RPi Zero has two micro USP ports, one for USB OTG and the other for just power.
The RPi Zero power circuit has a blocking diode on the
USB power input to prevent dueling power supplies.
The standard USB ports and GPIO pins do not have that diode.
The Pi Foundation recommends adding a blocking diode when powering a RPi through the GPIO ports.
* You can power the RPi Zero thought the USB OTG port, but not recommended.

## RPi Zero v1.3 Camera Enabled
[Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.3][06] comes with a frequently requested feature: a camera connector,
but there is a small catch.
While the Raspberry Pi camera modules themselves will work just fine on the Pi Zero,
the usual camera cable they come with will not.
The [Pi Zero’s camera cable connector][68] is a little smaller than the ones on the full-grown Pi,
so it needs a special cable to interface the camera modules
to the slightly smaller connector found on the Pi Zero.

## USB Gadget
[!usb-go](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/USB_OTG_Logo.svg)
The Raspberry Pi Zero (and model A and A+) support [USB On The Go][01].
USB On-The-Go is an extension of the USB 2.0 specification
for connecting peripheral devices to each other.
USB OTG products can communicate with each other without the need to be connected to a host computer.
USB OTG devices, known as dual-role peripherals,
can act as limited hosts or peripherals themselves depending on how
the cables are connected to the devices, and they also can connect to a host PC.
(**Note:** Although the model A and A+ can support being a USB slave,
they are missing the ID pin, which is tied to ground internally,
so are unable to dynamically switch between USB master/slave mode.
As such, they default to USB master mode.)

The magic happens in the “gadget mode” firmware of the PI Zero.
Since it doesn’t have the USB HUB chip in the way like other models (RPi B/B+)
it can be configured in device mode.
This makes it appear to any host computer as a virtual USB network adaptor
– so you can immediately access it as though it were Ethernet connected.
It also possible to set it up to appear as mass storage device, keyboard, mouse or any other USB peripheral!

In order to connect a USB device (mouse, keyboard, WiFi, etc.),
you'll need a you’ll also need a suitable OTG cable or connector for your device.
Electrically, there isn't anything special about the OTG cable,
only that it has a male micro USB on one end and a female Type A USB connector on the other end.
You can [grab one for a few bucks on Amazon][02].
If you need to connect multiple USB devices,
a simple USB hub will do what you need.
A powered hub is even better,
you can power the RPi Zero from the hub.
The power cable does not pass any data,
just plug the power micro USB cable into one of the ports.

Using the Linux USB Gadget modules (list in the parentheses below),
the RPi Zero can emulate a whole host of USB devices including:

* **Serial** (`g_serial`) – So can get a serial connection via Putty or Screen into the RPi Zero,
similar to using the UART pins.
* **Ethernet** (`g_ether`) – Make the RPi Zero appear as a USB Ethernet modem,
and with the right configuration, you can then get full TCP/IP services.
* **Ethernet and Serial** (`g_cdc`) - _Not clear what this is._
* **Mass storage and Serial** (`g_acm_ms`) – You can get the RPi Zero to appear as a flash drive,
allowing you to copy files over and then process them.
* **MIDI** (`g_midi`) – The RPi Zero could appear as a virtual MIDI instrument.
* **Audio** (`g_audio`) – The RPi Zero could appear as a virtual headphone output or microphone input.
* **Keyboard/Mouse** (`g_hid`) – The RPi Zero could appear as a virtual keyboard or mouse.
So when you plug the RPi Zero into a computer, it could start typing!
* **Webcam** (`g_webcam`) – Allows you to configure the device as if its a webcam
* **Printer** (`g_printer`) – The Raspberry Pi Zero appears to be a printer
* **Multi** (`g_multi`) - Allows you to combine up to 3 Gadget modules at a time
(although Windows and Mac have difficulty handling it)
* **Gadget Tester** (`g_zero`) – Used for testing purposes

## Console Access to RPi Zero
[!sereial-cable](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/954-02.jpg)
A [USB to TTL serial cable][35] (aka console cable)
can be used to connect to [system console][36] on the Raspberry Pi Zero.
(Make sure to use a cable having 3.3V logic levels. Not all cables are 3.3V!)
The great advantage of connecting this way is that
you do not need keyboard, mouse, or display attached to the RPi to log into it.
It can even supply the power for your RPi.
The RPi uses its built-in serial port to allow devices to connect to its console,
via a terminal emulater like [`screen`][66],
and issue commands just as if you were logged in.
The posting "[How to Run Raspberry Pi with No Monitor or Network][39]"
can give you additional information.

Connect the console cable to the RPi pins in the table below.
The location of these GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi (all types) is illustrated in the picture below
(see [Raspberry Pi A+ , B+ , Zero, Pi 2 GPIO Pinout][37] and
[Raspberry Pi 3 Model B GPIO 40 Pin Block Pinout][38] for additional detail):

[pin-out!](http://workshop.raspberrypiaustralia.com/assets/console-cable-connections.jpg)
[pin-out!](https://www.element14.com/community/servlet/JiveServlet/previewBody/80667-102-1-338789/GPIO.png)

|   Raspberry Pi   |   Serial Cable    |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| VCC → RPi Pin 02 | DC Power 5V - red |
| GND → RPi Pin 06 | Ground - black    |
| RXD → RPi Pin 08 | TX - white        |
| TXD → RPi Pin 10 | RX - green        |

**NOTE:** Only connect to VCC / Pin 02 if you are **not** supply power via the USB.

The console cable is a USB serial device,
and I have give it a [usb persistent name][64] of `ccable33v`.
(For the Adafruit console cable,
I added the following UDEV rule to a file in the `/etc/udev/rules.d.` directory:
`SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2303", SYMLINK+="ccable33v"`.)
With this, I can log into my RPi Zero device with:

```bash
# login to raspberry pi console
sudo screen /dev/ccable33v 115200,cs8

# NOTE: press CTRL + A then k. To logout and kill all screen session
```

**NOTE:** If this doesn't work, make sure you have the serial console correctly configured.
During the Raspberry Pi configuration using `sudo raspi-config`, select "Boot Options" and choose "B1 Console".
You will need a password to get console access,
which gives you greater security, and allow console cables to work via [`screen`][66].

# Raspberry Pi Zero Set Up
The objective here is to get the RPi Zero up and running without the need for any
USB keyboard, mouse, or HDMI monitor.
Set it up as a [headless device][03], and to do so,
we'll need to make use of the USB OTG capabilities of the RPi Zero.

To setting up the Raspberry Pi Zero as a USB Slave (OTG mode),
we'll use the `g_ether` driver creating a virtual Ethernet device
(allowing full SSH, SFTP, VNC etc).
The other USB Gadget drivers (beside `g_ether`)
can be done after the first boot and we have the RPi Zero up and working.

## Step 0: Configuring the SD Card - DONE
Download and install the latest Raspbian Jessie onto a suitably large SD card,
and expand the root partition.
This has been described in many place, including [my description (Steps 1 & 2)][03].
Once you're done, plug the micro SD card into the Micro SD Card holder on the Zero.

## Step 1: Setting Up RPi Zero OTG - DONE
On a non-Zero Raspberry Pi, like the RPi A,
the next step would be to configure the WiFi on the SD Card so you can log in,
or on the RPi B model, just plug in an Ethernet cable.
Can't do ether of these with the RPi Zero since it has neither WiFi or Ethernet.
In the RPi Zero case, In Steps 1 to Step 3 show you how to use the powers of the USB Gadget.
You could avoid the completity of this by using a WiFi dongle
and a [Micro USB to USB OTG Adapter][69] or [Ultra Mini DM Micro USB 5pin OTG Adapter Connector][70].
Place this on the RPi Zero USB and follow Steps
["HowTo: Set-Up the Raspberry Pi as a Headless Device"][03].

To enable the USB Gadget capability on the RPi Zero,
first the SD Card's `/boot` directory files need to be properly configure to enable USB Gadget mode.
The [video showing how to configure USB OTG][09] and the article
"Raspberry Pi Zero – Programming over USB! - [Part 1][10] and [Part 2][11]"
provides detail documentation.

With the SD Card mounted, you need to edit two files in the `/boot` directory.
Within the file `/boot/config.txt`, add the following line at the bottom of the file
(including a newline):

```
# dwc2 USB controller driver enables USB Gadget mode
dtoverlay=dwc2
```

Next, open up the file  `/boot/cmdline.txt`.
Be careful with this file, it is very picky with its formatting!
Each parameter is separated by a single space (it does not use newlines).
Insert `modules-load=dwc2,g_ether` after `rootwait`.
After the insertion, the line should look like this

```
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait modules-load=dwc2,g_ether quiet init=/usr/lib/raspi-config/init_resize.sh
```

Eject the SD card from your computer.

## Step 2A: Connecting with it as USB Gadget (Ubuntu) - DONE
To connect to the RPi Zero over USB,
you’ll need [Bonjour][12], or the Linux [Avahi Daemon][12] or similar
[zero configuration discovery service][13] on your host computer.
My Ubuntu Linux distributions has this all already installed.

Put the SD Card into the RPi Zero, power it up, and connect it via standard USB to your computer.
It will take up to 90s to boot up (shorter on subsequent boots).
Use `lsusb` to validate that the RPi Zero as an Ethernet Gadget has been sensed by the host computer via:

```bash
# check for the RPi Zero gadget
$ lsusb | grep Gadget
Bus 002 Device 013: ID 0525:a4a2 Netchip Technology, Inc. Linux-USB Ethernet/RNDIS Gadget
```

The new USB interface causes a [network hotplug][14]
event reporting that a new network interface has been registered.
At this time, the interface might look like this via `ifconfig` or `ip addr show`:

This demonstrates that the Linux host does in fact see the RPi Zero USB Gadget
as an Ethernet interface, but gives it a strange name of `enp0s29u1u7`.
The next question is, does services like TCP/IP SSH see the USB Gadget?
This seems unlikely since the USB Gadget doesn't have a IP address assigned to it.

To further validate this,
login via SSH from a Linux terminal from the RPi Zero's host machine:

```bash
# confirm that the RPi Zero is online
$ ping raspberrypi.local
ping: unknown host raspberrypi.local

# if RPI Zero is online, login into it
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
ssh: Could not resolve hostname raspberrypi.local: Name or service not known
```

In my case, this didn't initially work and it made me suspicious that
[Multicast Domain Name System (mDNS)][17] wasn't working properly.
mDNS is one of the features of Bonjour, included in Mac OS X 10.2 or later,
and the linux equivalent called [Avahi][16].
mDNS resolves host names to IP addresses within small networks that do not include a local name server.
It is a [zero-configuration service (aka Zeroconf)][16],
using essentially the same programming interfaces,
packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast [Domain Name System (DNS)][28].
When an mDNS client needs to resolve a host name,
it sends an IP multicast query message that asks the host having that name to identify itself.
That target machine then multicasts a message that includes its IP address.
All machines in that subnet can then use that information to update their mDNS caches.

Networking device hostnames ending with [`.local`][18] are often employed in private networks,
where they are resolved either via the multicast domain name service (mDNS)
or local Domain Name System (DNS) servers.
Anywhere that a you could normally use a DNS name such as "www.apple.com",
you could instead enter the Bonjour name of the computer on the local network.
To indicate that the name should be looked up using local multicast instead of a standard DNS query,
all Bonjour host names end with the extension ".local."
This helps avoid confusion between names that are local Bonjour computer names
("mycomputer.local") and globally unique DNS names ("www.apple.com").

First I wanted to make sure that the `avahi-deamon` is running and its status was OK.
I did this with the following:

```bash
# is the avahi-daemon running
$ ps -e | grep avahi
  967 ?        00:00:02 avahi-daemon
 1012 ?        00:00:00 avahi-daemon

```

So the Aiahi daemon is running and the daemon appears to be registering the USB Gadget `enp0s29u1u7`
_but then shortly after it is withdrawn_.
I tried restarting the service with `sudo service avahi-daemon restart`,
but that did not help.

[Some say][19] that [NetworkManager][21] could be getting in the way,
and it may make sense to [disable NetworkManager][22]
on some or all your interfaces.
You can check to see if NetworkManager is running
via the command `service NetworkManager status`.
My experimentation has shown me that removing NetworkManager could cause other problems.
I (and many others) have had problems with NetworkManager before,
so I suspect its the root of my troubles.

## Step 2B: Connecting with it as USB Gadget (Raspberry Pi) - DONE
The Raspberry Pi Linux distribution doesn't use NetworkManager
([but some people have installed it][20]),
so I connected the RPi Zero into a RPi B USB port and it work immediately!
I was able to SSH into without problem.

The network interface on the RPi B looked like this:

Notice how the RPi Zero Ethernet Gadget appears to be on a separate domain `169.254.112.117`.
This is very strange!

I suspect this strange IP address is resulting from a faulty assumption on my part.
I should not assume that [DHCP][33] can help me,
and instead I must supply a static IP address.
After all, the USB Gadget isn't really on my LAN, where the DHCP server is,
it is attached to a USB.
We are atempting to communicate with it via TCP/IP but it needs its own network.

I'm going to assume another [private network][34] with addressing `10.0.1.x`.
On this network, the RPi B host will have IP address `10.0.1.1`
and the RPi Zero USB Gadget will have address `10.0.1.2`.
**NOTE:** You'll see this addressing scheme being used below without any futher motivation.

## Step 3: Bridging Via Host PC to Allow Gadget to Reach the Internet - DONE
Now we want to update the the RPi Zero with the latest software
and that will require Internet access.
If you now login into the RPi Zero and `ping` a know host on the Internet,
you'll find that you can't reach it:

```bash
# log into the RPi Zero
$ ssh -X pi@raspberry.local

# ping Google
$ ping google.com
ping: unknown host google.com

# ping Google's IP address
$ ping 172.217.4.206
connect: Network is unreachable
```

To gain Internet access, the RPi Zero, and its supporting host
(i.e. the Linux system its plugged into via USB) needs to support three things:

* The host and RPi Zero both must be on a common IP network
* The RPi Zero must use its host as an [Internet Gateway][27]
(its assumed the host has access to the Internet directly or via a gateway)
* The RPi Zero must have an assigned [DNS server][31]
(such as Google's [`8.8.8.8`][26]) so it can resolve host names.

For all this to work and gain Internet access,
you must mapping the RPi Zero IP address space into the host's
by modifying network address information in Internet Protocol (IP) datagram packet headers.
This is called [Network Address Translation (NAT)][29].
More specifically, we need to use a form of NAT called [IP Masquerading][30]
which allows internally connected computers to communicate to the Internet
without communicating directly to a LAN's router
([this paper][67] gives a good explanation).
In essence, we are asking the host to act like a router,
that is transfer IP packets from one network to another, and generally,
computers refuse to act like routers.
To over come this, you need to specifically enabled that it is to
transfer IP packets from one network to another.
This is call [IP Forwarding][32].

To setup the host on another private network (via the USB as the network interface),
_login into the host_ and make this entry into the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:


```bash
# static IP address to interface USB Gadget (RPi Zero)
auto usb0
allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
    address 10.0.1.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Then restart the network interfaces with the command `sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart`.
Now the `usb0` network interface should have the new IP address.
Check it with:

~~~~{.bash hl_lines="3"}
# check usb0 ip address
$ ifconfig usb0
usb0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 4e:31:3a:db:3d:a8
          inet addr:10.0.1.1  Bcast:10.0.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::4c31:3aff:fedb:3da8/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:167 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:198 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:31085 (30.3 KiB)  TX bytes:37989 (37.0 KiB)
~~~~

The next step is to get access to the Internet.
This is done by [IP Masquerading, a form of Network Address Translation (NAT)][63].
To let the RPi Zero get the access to the Internet via its Linux host,
_login into the host_ and do the following
(_assumes_ that the host is connected to the LAN via the `eth0` network interface):

```bash
# tell kernel that you want to allow IP forwarding
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward > /dev/null

# or you could do the following
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# tell iptables to forward the packets from interface usb0 to LAN / Internet on interface eth0
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE -s 10.0.1.0/25
```

**IS THIS - The wrong way to masquerade - see this** - http://www.billauer.co.il/ipmasq-html.html

At this point, your route table should look something like this on the host:

```bash
$ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         FIOS_Quantum_Ga 0.0.0.0         UG    202    0        0 eth0
10.0.1.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 usb0
link-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     203    0        0 usb0
192.168.1.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     202    0        0 eth0
```

The `iptables` rules on the host should look like this:

```bash
# to see your iptable rules
$ sudo iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
```

To give the RPi Zero a DNS server, log into the RPi Zero and do the following:

```bash
# append comment in file
echo -e "\\n# Google DNS" | sudo tee --append /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null

# append the name server
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee --append /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null

# set the default gateway
sudo route add default gw 10.0.1.1
```

Also on the RPi Zero, provide the IP address for the `usb0` interface and
restart the interface with `sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart`.
Here are the charges need to `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```bash
# static IP address for USB Gadget (RPi Zero)
auto usb0
allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
    address 10.0.1.2
    netmask 255.255.255.0
```

>**NOTE**: If you want these changes to persist after a reboot,
it is best pratice to not append the name server with data,
but instead, put `dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8` within the iface stanza above.
This way, the this DNS entry would survive a reboot.
Also, to make the routing table changes persistent,
place `gateway 10.0.1.1` in the same stanza.
To make the IP Forwarding permanent insert or edit the following line in
`/etc/sysctl.conf`: `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1`
See below on how to make the iptable updates persistent.

On the RPi Zero, the routing table will look something like this:

```bash
$ route
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         10.0.1.1        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 usb0
10.0.1.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 usb0
link-local      *               255.255.0.0     U     202    0        0 usb0
```

Now retest the RPi Zero's ability to reach the Internet:

```bash
$ ping -c 3 google.com
PING google.com (216.58.195.142) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from iad23s24-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.195.142): icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=10.0 ms
64 bytes from iad23s24-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.195.142): icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=20.4 ms
64 bytes from iad23s24-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.195.142): icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=11.0 ms

--- google.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2004ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 10.040/13.874/20.486/4.696 ms
```

To stop the forwarding of IP messages from the RPi Zero,
you can use the following commands:

```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward > /dev/null
sudo iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING
```

The actual iptables rules are created and
customized on the command line with the command `iptables` for IPv4
(and `ip6tables` for IPv6) but will no be there after reboot.
The firewall rules created so far will not survive a reboot of your system.
To overcome this,
you need to use the `iptables-save` or `iptables-persistent`
(or `netfilter-persistent` for Ubuntu 16.04).

```bash
# make backup of current itables rules
sudo cp /etc/iptables/rules.v4 /etc/iptables/backup_rules.v4

# make backup of currently active rules
sudo iptables-save > $HOME/tmp/backup_rules.v4

# make the currently active rules persistent over reboots
# (ie load them into /etc/iptables/rules.v4)
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

To restore iptables rule that you may have saved

```bash
# make your backup rules your active rules
sudo iptables-restore < $HOME/tmp/backup_rules.v4
```

## Step 4: Configuring the Raspberry Pi Zero - DONE
With the above steps complete, you can follow the article
["HowTo: Set-Up the Raspberry Pi as a Headless Device"][03] to complete the install.
Specifically, make sure to do at least the following:

* Step 5: Configure the Raspberry Pi
* Step 6: OS Updates
* Step 7: Updating Firmware for Raspberry Pi

## Step 5: Adding WiFi to the Zero - DONE
If you determined to have WiFi for your RPi Zero, it can be done.
You could [try using an ESP8266][42].
But the ESP8266 is a WiFi (aka wireless Ethernet) to serial device
(you don't get access to TCP/IP directly).
To work around this, you could simply connect ESP8266 to the serial port in the RPi Zero
and start a WiFi point-to_point (PPP) connection to some other machine on your WiFi network,
giving you terminal access.
But unfortunately the ESP8266 doesn’t provide PPP support.
The article "[RASPBERRY PI ZERO + ESP8266 = INTERNET?!][24]"
and [software from Jee Labs][40] does provide away around all this.
Effectively a [wireless to serial bridge][41] but its more
like a WiFi co-processor to web-enable, reprogram,
and control a other wise simple/dumb microprocessor.

The posting "[Add a Tiny Wi-Fi Board to a Raspberry Pi Zero][23]"
shows how you can solder onto the RPi Zero board a WiFi USB dongle,
effectively bypassing the micro USB connector with a standard USB.
It's much easier to just use a [Micro USB OTG Adapter][43] and a [WiFi USB Adapter][44].
With this in place, you just need to provision the RPi Zero
like any Raspberry Pi for WiFi connectivity.
This can be done by following "Step 3: Configure your WiFi" within
["HowTo: Set-Up the Raspberry Pi as a Headless Device"][03].

I added the following to the  `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

```bash
# establish connection to home wifi and other known networks
auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

And the following to the `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` file:

```bash
# home wifi network settings
network={
    id_str="home"
    ssid="my-wifi"
    scan_ssid=1
    psk="my-wifi-password"
    proto=RSN
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    pairwise=CCMP
    auth_alg=OPEN
}
```

Now reboot you RPi Zero, put in the micro USB OTB adapter along with the WiFi USB adapter,
and you should be able to login.
But in this case, your using your home WiFi's LAN and its [DHCP][33] instead of
provisioning another IP network using static addressing,
as you did for the USB Gadget scenario.
In fact, if you did this on the SD Card earlier in Step 1,
you could skip the USB Gadget stuff all together ...
but then you wouldn't have learned about all of the RPi Zero's USB Gadgetry!

## Step 6: Zero Battery Supply (Optional) - DONE
The size and power consumption of the Raspberry Pi Zero makes it possible to create battery powered
solutions like body camera and small stealthy spycam applications.
You can replacing the micro USB wall charger, and start powering with batteries.
A [Lithium Ion Polymer Battery][61] and a corresponding Adafruit [PowerBoost 1000C Charger][62]
can be an effective solution.
It has built-in load-sharing battery charger circuit.
So it will automatically switch over to the USB power when available,
instead of continuously charging/draining the battery,
making it a Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).

## Step 7A: Battery Power Monitoring (Optional) - DONE
If you're running off of a battery, your going to want to know when its running dry,
and gracefully shutdown the Raspberry Pi.
How long your project will run on batteries can be estimated by knowing
the capacity of your batteries and the amount of current consumed by your project.
Battery capacity (in mAh) / Average current consumption (in mA) = Hours of expected runtime.

In addition, to sense your batteries ability to continue to supply power,
you need to monitor its output voltage.
A fully charged Lipoly battery will give you 4.2V but stick around 3.7V for much of the battery life.
It then slowly sink down to 3.2V or so before the protection circuitry on the battery cuts it off.
By measuring the voltage you can quickly tell when you're heading to 3.2V
and intervene to do your own graceful shutdown.

A great way to measure voltage and current over time is by using the
[INA219-based current sensor breakout][84].
The INA219 can be attached directly in series with the power input of this project
and queried over the INA219's I2C interface to read current consumption.
Using the Raspberry Pi's ability I2C interface,
you can record the current consumption and voltage level of your project over time.
The following articles could be helpful:

* [Adafruit INA219 Current Sensor Breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ina219-current-sensor-breakout)
* [Battery Life & Current Consumption](https://learn.adafruit.com/low-power-wifi-datalogging/battery-life-and-current-consumption)

## Step 7B: Battery Supply + Power Monitoring - DONE
[!LiFePO4wered/Pi](https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/9332751457457361166.jpg)
The [LiFePO4wered/Pi][85] (purchase on [Tindie][87])
may be the best power solution for the Raspberry Pi Zero.
It combines both the UPS and power monitoring functions into a single solution.
It also has PCB touch button that gives you clean shutdown instead of just pulling power.
A ultra-low power [MSP430G2231 microcontroller][86] monitors the battery
and also connected to the Pi's I2C bus and monitors the Pi's running state.

The dsigner provides a [open source software package to interact with the LiFePO4wered/Pi][88].
It contains an application development library,
a CLI interface to read/write device registers over the I2C bus,
and a tiny daemon (`lifepo4wered-daemon`) that continually tracks the power state.
The daemon can initiate a clean shutdown when the battery is empty
or the user wants to turn the RPi off using the touch button.
Touch button parameters, voltage thresholds,
and an auto boot flag can be customized by the user and saved to flash.
You can also set it up so the RPi will automatically boot whenever there is enough battery charge.
There is also a wake up timer that can be set so the Pi can shut down,
and automatically be started again after the wake timer expires.

The LiFePO4wered/Pi works fine for the Raspberry Pi Zero and 1,
but it could have difficulty maintaining a charge for a RPi 2 or 3 under load.
The  latest version, the [LiFePO4wered/18650][89], can hand these heavy load conditions.
You can even get a case with room for the RPi3 and the LiFePO4wered/Pi [on Tindie][90].
**Note:** Adafruit has a similar solution to the LiFePO4wered/Pi
doing a [hack of its PowerBoost 500 Charger][25].

The LiFePO4wered/Pi requires software to be running on the Raspberry Pi to operate correctly.
This software provides a daemon that automatically
manages the power state and shutdown of the RPi,
a library that allows integration of LiFePO4wered/Pi functionality in user programs,
and a CLI (command line interface) program that allows the user to
easily configure the LiFePO4wered/Pi or control it from shell scripts.
Load the software RPi Zero via

```bash
# clone software package
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/xorbit/LiFePO4wered-Pi.git

# build the software
cd LiFePO4wered-Pi
python build.py

# install the software
# this also performs enablement of I2C bus and GPIO UART
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
```

At this time, the blinking LiFePO4wered/Pi PWR LED should now go on solid.
If the PWR LED does not yet go on solid,
it is likely that the I2C was not yet enabled before the installer was run,
and a reboot is required.

The only necessary user interaction is with the touch button,
with feedback provided by the green PWR LED.
The LiFePO4wered/Pi touch button can be used to turn the Raspberry Pi on and off.
The touch button needs to be pressed and held to take effect.
During this press-and-hold delay, the PWR LED glow will ramp up.
During booting or shutdown,
if the user touches the button during this time,
the PWR LED will do a quick flashing sequence to
indicate it cannot comply with the user request at that time.

To make it convenient to interact with the LiFePO4wered/Pi,
the software package installed on the RPi provides a command line tool.

```bash
# get help message
lifepo4wered-cli

# get the current battery voltage
# returns the battery voltage in millivolts
lifepo4wered-cli get vbat

# get the supply voltage
# returns the  raspberry pi supply battery voltage in millivolts
lifepo4wered-cli get vout

# to set the wake time to an hour
# if you shut down the Raspberry Pi, it will wake up again in about 60 minutes
lifepo4wered-cli set wake_time 60

# Raspberry Pi to always run whenever there is power to do so
lifepo4wered­cli set auto_boot 1
```

# Adding a Camera to the Raspberry Pi Zero - DONE
[camera!](http://raspi.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PiZero1.3_700.jpg)
[camera!](http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-15-16.32.19-800x420.jpg)
[Raspberry Pi Zero version 1.3][06] has a camera connector,
and I'll be installing the version 2.1 camera
(previous version was v1.3 5MP and 1080p).
This [camera is 8 Megapixel, 1080p, and Better in Low Light][45]
and in general a [better camera][57].
The Zero’s camera cable connector is a little smaller than the ones used on the other Raspberry Pi.
This [Second Generation Raspberry Pi Camera Module][46] has the following specs:

* Fixed Focus Lens
* Sony [Exmor][49] [IMX219][48] Sensor Capable of [4K30][47], [1080P60][50], [720P180][51], 8MP Still
* 3280 (H) x 2464 (V) Active Pixel Count
* Maximum of 1080P30 and 8MP Stills in Raspberry Pi Board
* 2A Power Supply Highly Recommended

To activate the camera features on the RPi Zero,
access the configuration settings for the RPi by running the command:

```bash
# configure the raspberry pi camera
sudo raspi-config
```

Then navigate to “camera” and select “enable”.
Select “Finish” and reboot.

The installation of the camera cable must be done carefully and
its proper installation is illustrated in this picture:

[camera-cable](http://raspi.tv/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/PiZero1.3_700.jpg)

You can find [detail documentation on camera usage online][52].
A summary for [taking still pictures][54] and [taking videos][53] is given below.

To take a picture with the camera, do the following:

```bash
# take picture and store in image.jpg
raspistill -o ~/tmp/image.jpg --width 1024 --height 768

# display picture for viewing
display ~/tmp/image.jpg
```

You can also capture video with the camera.
To capture a 5 seconds of video in [H.264/MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC)][108] format:

```bash
# capture video in file video.h264
raspivid -o ~/tmp/video.h264 --width 1024 --height 768 --codec H264

# play the video
mplayer ~/tmp/video.h264
```

Other possibilities for your camera are things like [time lapse photography][65] or
[`picamera`][55] which is a Python interface to the Raspberry Pi camera module
(source code [here][56]).
Or can do something more sophisticated like stream video to a web browser
via the Python package [`pistreaming`][58]
or with [`OpenCV`][59], or via [`motion`][60].
These implementations are limited since the video streamer and the web browser
must be on the same network.
In the subsequent sections,
we will work around these and other limitations.

## Key Differences Between Streamed and Static Video Media
The key consideration when streaming media to a browser
is the fact that rather than playing a finite file,
we are relaying a file that is being created on the fly,
and has no pre-determined start or end.
This finite file sits on a server and can be delivered,
like most other files, to the browser
(ths is known as a [progressive download][126]).
Live [streamed media][127] lacks a finite start and end time, as in static file.
It is a stream of data that the server passes on down the line to the browser
and often uses [adaptive streaming][128].
Adaptive streaming works by detecting a user's bandwidth and CPU capacity in real time
and adjusting the quality of a video stream accordingly.
There a [multiple adaptive streaming formats][129] available.

## Streaming Camera to Web Page - DONE
The [introductory article about the camera module][99]
in the Raspberry Pi blog shows a method to [stream video][104]
from the Raspberry Pi to another computer.
(See "How does video streaming work?", [Part 1][105], [Part 2][106], [Part 3][107].)
This method essentially works as follows:

* On the Pi the `raspivid` utility is used to [encode H.264 video][100] from the camera
* The video stream is piped to the [netcat (`nc`)][101] utility,
which pushes it out to the network address where the video player is.
* On the player computer `nc` receives the stream and pipes it into [`mplayer`][102] to play.

This is an efficient method of streaming video from the Pi to another computer,
but it has a few problems for my use:

* The Raspberry Pi needs to know the address of the computer that is playing the video
* The playing computer needs to have an advanced player that can play a raw H.264 video stream.
* Since this system relies on a direct connection between the Pi and the player,
it is impossible to have the player computer connect and/or disconnect from the stream,
the connection needs to be on at all times.
* And what if you want to support two, three, or N concurrent players?
This cannot be done with this method.

An important requirement for my streaming camera needs are that you can view it with ease.
To me, this means that the video stream should be playable from a web browser.
Having to run a specific player, aka video decoder, is a complication I don't want.
So I want something that will work on any browser.
There are a few modern streaming protocols for web browsers out there
but all the incompatible options is really annoying.
[Choosing a video format for stream to a website is a complicated topic][117].

* [HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)][124] is Apple's choice.
It isn’t supported natively by any desktop browser except for Safari.
It is supported on mobile.
This means you will need either a Silverlight or Flash player to play the stream on your desktop,
which is great except Chrome no longer supports either of these things.
* [MPEG-DASH][123] is better though there is no native support in the desktop browsers
yet but there are JavaScript implementations of it that allow its use via MSE.
* [Fragmented MP4][122] is supported by Adobe and Microsoft, but requires browser plugins
* [HTML5 video][125] is the new standard way to embed a video in a web page.
Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash),
but supported only on HTML5 compatible browsers like Chrome and FoxFire.

So I want to live video stream broadcast (not just point-to-point)
from my Raspberry Pi camera, to a webpage where a HTML5 compatible browser can play it
(see this site to test your browser for HTML5 compatibility - http://html5test.com/ ).

## HTML5 Video - DONE
In [modern browsers][131] (which loosely means a browser without workarounds
and conforming to the latest Web/HTML standards, e.g. a HTML5 compliant browser),
adding a video to your page is as easy as adding an image.
No longer do you need to deal with special plug-ins or require crazy markup,
you can do it with a single element.
For example,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>HTML5 Video Example-1</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> HTML Video Example-1</h1>
    <video src="/home/jeff/tmp/All-is-Full-of-Love-by-Bjork.mp4" controls>
    </video>
</body>
</html>
```

That's all you need to embed a simple video on a webpage
and show the basic controls so that a user can play,
pause, or otherwise control the video.
Of course, this can get more elaborate.
Check out  the posting "[HTML5 Video][132]" for examples
containing subtitles, opening posters, etc. like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>HTML5 Video Example-2</title>
	<style type="text/css">
	       html, body {
	           color: #FFFFFF;
	           text-align: center;
	           background-color: #111;
	       }
	</style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1> HTML Video Example-2</h1>
    <video controls style="width:640px;height:360px;" poster="https://thenewboston.com/images/forum/logos/145efe2aab7ca9959397d6344180b658.png">
        <source src="https://ia800201.us.archive.org/12/items/BigBuckBunny_328/BigBuckBunny_512kb.mp4"
            type="video/mp4">
        <track src="/home/jeff/tmp/mov_bbb.vtt" label="english subtitles"
            kind="subtitles" srclang="en" default></track>
    </video>
</body>
</html>
```

## Streaming Video Using Only the Raspberry Pi Zero - DONE
Despite the ease in which video files can be displayed within a HTML5 browser,
as shown in the previous section,
streaming to HTML5 in 2017 is still annoyingly hard.
I then came upone [PhotosLab HTML5 video streaming via websockets][133]
using a package called [JSMpeg][134].
[JSMpeg is a Video Player written in JavaScript][135].
It uses the broadcast industries [MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS, MTS or TS)][136] transport streaming format.
It it claims to do low latency streaming (~50ms) via WebSocktes,
decode 720p Video at 30fps on an iPhone 5S, and works in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Edge).
Dominic Szablewski, the creater of JSMpeg,
explains [here][137] why he resorting to what appears to be a browser hack makes sense.

To top it off, Dominic provde an [implementation for the Raspberry Pi][138].
Procedures for this are in the following section.

### Step 1: Install ffmpeg - DONE
[!ffmpeg](https://prupert.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/ffmpeg-logo.png)
[FFmpeg][95] claims to play pretty much anything that humans and machines have created;
supporting the most obscure ancient formats up to the cutting edge.
FFmpeg is able to decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play most anything.
Effectively, ffmpeg continuously streams a webcam's video to single `.jpg` file.
This toolkit contains:

* **[ffmpeg][94]** - is a command line tool for fast video and audio converter that can also grab from a live audio/video source.
* **[ffserver][93]** - is a streaming server for both audio and video.
* **[ffplay][92]** - is a command line simple and portable media player using the FFmpeg libraries and the SDL library.
* **[ffprobe][91]** - is a command line tool to gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in human- and machine-readable fashion.

Unfortanatelly, Debian Jessie and later [no longer include the ffmpeg package][140].
To install it and make sure we have the latest and greatest ffmpeg,
I choose to [install from source code][139].
The procedure for this is below
(Get some coffee, this will take over two hours on a Raspberry Pi Zero.):

```bash
# install all the packages you need
sudo apt-get install yasm nasm build-essential automake autoconf libtool pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev intltool libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-dev libnotify-dev libglib2.0-dev libevent-dev checkinstall

# clone the ffmpeg package or download the latest snapshot
cd ~/src
git clone git://git.videolan.org/ffmpeg.git

# compile ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg
./configure --prefix=/usr
time make -j 8

# use RELEASE in checkinstall's version
# (NOTE: to work, I needed to create manually the directory /usr/share/ffmpeg)
cat RELEASE
sudo checkinstall

# install the deb file you made for ffmpeg
sudo dpkg --install ffmpeg_*.deb
```

### Step 2: Install node, npm, and Web Server - DONE
You need to install Node.js and npm, if not done already.
Node is used to stream the video, via a websocket, to a HTML5 browser.

Just to make sure I have maximum control over my `node.js` version,
like versioning for `ffmpeg`, I'm going to
head to the [Node.js download page][142] and grab the latest version.
For Linux, you can also install Node via the package manager,
for example [installing on Node.js on Ubuntu 16.04][143].
The install option I prefer is to use [Node Version Manager, `nvm`][144],
which give you on-demand access to the newest versions of Node.js,
but will also allow you to target previous releases that your app may depend on.
If you work with a lot of different Node.js utilities and projects,
you know sometimes you need to switch to other versions of Node.js.
That's where you can use `nvm` to download, install, and use different versions of Node.js.

```bash
# remove any previously installed version of node.js
sudo apt-get remove nodejs-legacy npm

# install required packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev

# install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash

# make sure to restart your terminal window
# verify theat nvm is installed which should output 'nvm' if the installation was successful
# NOTE: 'which nvm' will not work, since nvm is a sourced shell function, not an executable binary
command -v nvm
nvm --version

# to find out the versions of Node.js that are available for installation
nvm ls-remote
```
When you install Node.js using `nvm`,
the executable is called `node`.
You can see the version currently being used by the shell by typing `node -v`.

```bash
# you can install latest stable version of node
nvm install stable

# what version of node is currently being used
node -v

# list the multiple node.js versions installed
nvm ls

# you can install a specific version of node
nvm install 6.0.0

# to make one of the versions your default
# this version will be automatically selected when a new session spawns
nvm alias default 6.0.0

# can also switch to your default be using an alias
nvm use default

# to switch to and use another node.js version
nvm use 4.2.6
```

Verify your installation, which should also include the Node Package Manager, `npm`.

```bash
# where is node.js located
$ which node
/usr/bin/node

# what version of node.js are your using
$ node --version
v4.2.6

# location and version of node package manager
$ which npm
/usr/local/bin/npm
$ npm --version
4.1.1
```
For this streaming video solution using JSMpeg,
you'll also need to install http-server.
This webserver will be use serve the static files
(view-stream.html, jsmpeg.min.js)
that we can view the video in our browser.
If you wanted to, any other webserver would work as well (nginx, apache, etc.)

```bash
# install a node web server
npm install -g http-server
```

### Step 3: Install JSMpeg - DONE

```bash
# clone the jsmpeg repository
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg.git

# install node.js websocket library
cd jsmpeg
npm install ws
```

### Step 4: Start the Websocket Relay - DONE
We'll now start things up and send our Raspberry Pi video to a web browser.
First, you must start the Websocket relay.
To do this, you must provide a password and a port for the incomming HTTP video stream from the camera.
You also provide a Websocket port that can connect to with a browser to see the video.

Within a terminal window on the Raspberry Pi, start up the Websocke relay:

```bash
# start the websocket relay
cd ~/src/jsmpeg
$ node websocket-relay.js password 8081 8082
Listening for incomming MPEG-TS Stream on http://127.0.0.1:8081/<secret>
Awaiting WebSocket connections on ws://127.0.0.1:8082/
```
Within a second terminal window, start your `http-server`
so we can serve the `view-stream.html` to a browser:

```bash
# start the web server so you can connect with the websocket
cd ~/src/jsmpeg
$ http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.1.27:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Now within a third terminal window,
start `ffmpeg` to capture the Raspberry Pi video
and send it to the Websocket relay.
Provide the password and port from the above step in your destination URL:

```bash
# to access the camera board on /dev/video0 run
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

# start ffmpeg to capture video and send it to the websocket relay
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://localhost:8081/password
```

**NOTE:**
You can avoid running the `modprobe` by
putting `modprobe bcm2835-v4l2` in `/etc/rc.local` so it runs on every boot automatically.

While all of this appear to sort-of work on the Raspberry Pi Zero,
it never performed acceptably.
I suspect this was due to the fact that the camera streaming (`ffmpeg`),
the WebSocket Relay (`websocket-relay.js`),
and the web server to view the video (`http-server`)
were all on the under powered Zero.

## Streaming Video But Distributing the Load - DONE
The `ffmpeg` process must run on the Raspberry Pi Zero,
but the other processes do not.

On my Linux box, `desktop`, I placed both
the WebSocket Relay (`websocket-relay.js`),
and the web server to view the video (`http-server`).
I created a clone of JSMpeg in `~/src/zetta-demo/tools`
and its IP address is `192.168.1.200`.

```bash
# goto where  you keep the websocket relay
cd ~/src/zetta-demo/tools/jspeg

# start the websocket relay
$ node websocket-relay.js password 8081 8082
Listening for incomming MPEG-TS Stream on http://127.0.0.1:8081/<secret>
Awaiting WebSocket connections on ws://127.0.0.1:8082/
```

Within another terminal window on my Linux box:

```bash
# goto where  you keep the websocket relay
cd ~/src/zetta-demo/tools/jspeg

# start the web server so you can connect with the websocket
$ http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.1.200:8080
  http://192.168.1.13:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

Then on the Raspberry Pi Zero, I ran the following:

```bash
# start ffmpeg to capture video and send it to the websocket relay
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

# seems to work better on the rpi zero
avconv -f rawvideo -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

ffmpeg -f v4l2 -r 30 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 2592x1944 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

# show avalable formats
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -formats all -i /dev/video0

# to get a list of compatible modes run
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -list_formats all -i /dev/video0
```

And finally, run a HTML5 browser to see the video:

```bash
# display the video with a browser (assumes http-sever is running in home directory)
google-chrome http://192.168.1.200:8080/src/zetta-demo/tools/jsmpeg/view-stream.html

# this will not works here
google-chrome http://192.168.1.200:8080/?action=stream
```

```bash
# takes video from a file instead of a camera (frame rate  too fast)
ffmpeg -i All-is-Full-of-Love-by-Bjork.mp4 -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

# better frame rate but this is too choppy
ffmpeg -re -i All-is-Full-of-Love-by-Bjork.mp4 -c copy -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

# no re-encoding with this method - http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/377436-How-can-I-stream-h264-files-with-FFmpeg-over-rtmp-without-reencoding
# much better, with sound, some static but could be my sound system
ffmpeg -re -i All-is-Full-of-Love-by-Bjork.ts -codec copy -f mpegts -codec:v mpeg1video -s 640x480 -b:v 1000k -bf 0 http://192.168.1.200:8081/password

## Streaming Camera to a Local Web Page
## Streaming Camera to a Public Web Page




Some IP webcams do this by delivering [Motion JPEG or MJPEG][98] images.
MJPG just streams individual JPEG pictures, one after another.
(In fact, some people have created streaming video solution
using this concept of [streaming JPEG pictures][130].)
Most [modern browsers][103] (think HTML5) can play MJPEG streams natively.
The down side of MJPEG streams is that they are not as efficient as [H.264][116],
which greatly improves quality and reduces size
by encoding only the differences from one frame to the next.
I'm willing to put up with the inefficiency to get the flexibility of browser support.

This brings to what I choose to implement,
[`mjpg-streamer`][96], a small open source MJPEG streaming server
that has been ported to the Raspberry Pi.
`mjpg-streamer` has a HTTP server streaming plugin,
which starts a web server that that you can connect your browser to watch the video.
This is all we need if the objective is to stream the viedo on you local LAN.
If you want to watch the video from anywhere,
you'll need to give your Raspberry Pi a static address
and open a port and forward from your home router to the RPi,
and expose the RPi the wild world of the Internet.
I prefer not to do this, and how to work around this will be shown in a subsequent step.
For now, we'll focus on how to get video streaming to a browser on your local LAN.





### Stream Video from a Public Site via WebSocket
http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/?cam=tsrobo1
http://weheart.digital/build-simple-live-streaming-solution/

### Video Streaming with JSMpeg
This is low latency streaming of the Pi's camera module to any reasonably modern web browser.
It make use of JSMpeg, which is a Video Player written in JavaScript.
Other dependencies are the Python ws4py library, my picamera library (specifically version 1.7 or above), and FFmpeg

https://github.com/waveform80/pistreaming
https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg

### mjpg-streamer
[!mjpg-streamer](https://www.hqt.ro/wp-content/uploads/mjpg-streamer-fi1.png)
[`mjpg-streamer`][96] (its predecessor was `uvc_streamer`)
is a command line tool to stream JPEG files over an IP-based network
from a webcam to various types of viewers such as Chrome, Firefox, Cambozola, VLC, mplayer,
and other software capable of receiving MJPG streams.
It was originally written for embedded devices (e.g. OpenWrt) with very limited resources.
MJPG-streamer maybe the simplest way to stream a webcam.

The general consensus is that `mjpg-streamer` is faster and uses less CPU than most streamers,
so this may be ideal for your remote control projects in which real-time video feed is crucial for navigation
or light-weight hardware like the Raspberry Pi Zero.
Some webcams will deliver [Motion JPEG or MJPEG][98] images.
Mjpg-streamer is very efficient with these webcams,
as it just reads the images and streams them to the web.

The code block below will build a `mjpeg-streamer` from source
with added support for the Raspberry Pi camera via the `input_raspicam` plugin.
The build procedures and code are [on Github][96]
along with [documentation for `input_rapicam`][97], the Raspberry Pi plugin.

```bash
# make sure required tools and libraries are loaded
sudo apt-get install cmake libjpeg8-dev

# download, build, and install mjpg-streamer
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer.git
cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental
make
sudo make install
```

With `mjpg-streamer` built for the Raspberry Pi,
you can now execute it and view the live video within a browser
(works great with Google Chrome and Firefox but not so much with Safari):

```bash
# change directories to where the plugins are located or provide path in environment
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pi/src/mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental ; mjpg_streamer -i "input_raspicam.so -rot 90 -ex night -ifx none awb auto" -o "output_http.so -w www -p 8090"

# streaming video in browser
google-chrome http://127.0.0.1:8090/?action=stream
```

The meaning of the parameters used with the `input_raspicam` plugin can be found [here][97].

By the way, `mjpg-streamer` can also be used on Ubuntu,
just need to use another plugin.
An example is given here:

```bash
# change directories to where the plugins are located or provide path in environment
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jeff/src/mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental ; mjpg_streamer -i "input_uvc.so -f 15 -r 1280x720" -o "output_http.so -w www -p 8090"

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/jeff/src/mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental ; mjpg_streamer -i "input_uvc.so -q 85 -f 15 -r 1280x960" -o "output_http.so -w www -p 8090"

# streaming video in browser
google-chrome http://127.0.0.1:8090/?action=stream
```

## Step X: Streaming Camera to the Internet - DONE
So far, using the Raspberry Pi camera module,
I have streamed video on my local network
but I wish to do this across the Internet.
Your Raspberry Pi will be transformed into a video surveillance camera
that you can place anywhere you can get WiFi with Internet access
and see the live streaming on a browser anywhere in the world.
You can [make your `localhost` (aka `127.0.0.1`) accessible from anywhere in the world][111]
via a [secure tunnel][112] service, or more specifically, [reverse proxy][115].
This provides you a publicly accessible URL, that watch for calls on that URL,
and then forwards those calls to your localhost server.
You'll need to install some software
from a fee for service provider like [`ngrok`][110] or build your own.
Luckly, ngrok has a free option.
So ngrok is a simple utility that will take my local web server extablished by mjpg-streamer
(aka video streaming server) and makes it available on the web.

Now sign up to the ngrok public servier at `https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/signup`.
download ngrok, follow the [get strated page][114],
and check out the [ngrok documentation][113] for additional features.
The installation of `ngrok` is outlined below:

```bash
# download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download
# no need for ngrok-server since you'll be using the public site
unzip ~/Download/ngrok.zip
sudo mv ~/Download/ngrok /usr/local/bin

# print version number of ngrok
ngrok version

# go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started and get your authtoken
ngrok authtoken dffjgyiorggkjt4435403_ggghhgl89B3k9ddlgiggg

# create your first secure tunnel
# open the web interface at http://localhost:4040 to inspect and replay requests
ngrok http 80
```

Now fire up the camera and use `ngrok` to stream the camera's live video to a
to the URL provided by `ngrok`:

```bash
# start streaming the video on the raspberry pi zero
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/pi/src/mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer-experimental ; mjpg_streamer -i "input_raspicam.so -rot 90 -ex night -ifx none awb auto" -o "output_http.so -w www -p 8090"

# forward the video to the internet via ngrok
ngrok http 8090

# now using the url provide by ngrok, see the video in your broswer
google-chrome http://be4fac06.ngrok.io/?action=stream
```

## Step X: Potential Alternates for Streaming Camera - DONE
I did a considerable amount of research to identify `mjepg-streamer` as my solution.
It does appear to be the right choose, given all my constraint / requirements.
On the other hand, changing anyone of my assumtions could make it a poor choose.
Some of the alternatives that I investigate are documented here.

### webrtc, janus, gstreamer
[!webrtc](https://webrtc.org/assets/images/webrtc-logo-horiz-retro-750x140.png)
[WebRTC][71] is an open source project that provides browsers and mobile applications
with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities
for audio, video, and data in Web and native apps via simple APIs.
The vision of WebRTC is a world where your phone, TV and computer
could all communicate on a common platform where it is
easy to add video chat and peer-to-peer data sharing to your web application.
WebRTC is available now in Google Chrome, Opera, and Firefox.
A good place to see how simple video can be is to open
`[apprtc.appspot.com](https://apprtc.appspot.com/)`
or see the [WebRTC samples][74]
in Chrome, Opera or Firefox on a video enable computer.
The [WebRTC project "Getting Started" page][72]
and [Getting Started with WebRTC][73] are excellent places to start.

[!janus](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/janus-logo.png)
WebRTC has been conceived as a peer-to-peer solution:
that is, while signalling goes through a web server/application,
the media flow is peer-to-peer.
Nothing needed in the middle and only two participants.
Even in a simple peer-to-peer scenario,
one of the two involved parties (or maybe even both) doesn’t need to be a browser,
and may very well be a non-browser application.
So what if the application is "dumb" and doesn't know WebRTC?
Such an application will required a WebRTC Gateway:
one side talks WebRTC, while the other still WebRTC or something entirely different.
(See the post "[What is a WebRTC Gateway anyway?][78]").
A WebRTC Gateway is particularly useful for the many legacy infrastructures out there,
that may benefit from a WebRTC-enabled kind of access.
Also, the gateway could function to multicast, bridge, split, or otherwise process the streaming content
to create experiences you could otherwise have via a peer-to-peer solution (e.g. conferencing).
A popular a general purpose WebRTC gateway is [Janus][75].
In principle, you could use it to stream video from a Raspberry Pi directly to any browser
(doesn't have to be Google Chrome, Opera, or Firefox).
More importantly, you could create a more powerful user experince.
(See the presentation "[Janus: a general purpose WebRTC gateway][79]".)

[!gstreamer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Gstreamer-logo.svg/530px-Gstreamer-logo.svg.png)
[GStreamer][76] is a framework for creating streaming media applications.
The GStreamer framework is designed to make it easy to write applications
that handle audio or video or both.
It isn't restricted to audio and video,
and can process any kind of data flow.
Its main advantages are that the pluggable components can be mixed and matched
into arbitrary pipelines so that it's possible to write a
full-fledged video or audio editing application.
You can also use the pipelining capabilities of GStreamer
to take the video output from a Raspberry Pi camera module
and encode the video in H.264 format before passing it on to Janus.
GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework that links together
a wide variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows.
For instance, GStreamer can be used to build a system that reads files in one format,
processes them, and exports them in another.
The formats and processes can be changed in a plug and play fashion.
(See this [diagram of the pipeline processing][77] for an example.)
This processing can be done on the [shell command line][82] or via
[Python bingdings][80] or [C bindings][81].
The article "[Gstreamer basic real time streaming tutorial][83]"
is a good introductory tutorial for GStreamer.

```bash
# streams desktop camera

```


### motion
[!motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/pub/Motion/WebPreferences/motion-trans.gif)
[`motion`][109] is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more cameras
and is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has changed.
Or in other words, it can detect motion.
Motion has many features can be a bit overwhelming
but the articles "[How to Operate Linux Spycams With Motion][118]" and
"[How to Set Up Motion Detection Webcam in Ubuntu][119]" will get you going.

## WebSockets
Nice writeup - http://www.neotys.com/blog/testing-tips-for-todays-tech-html5-websockets-rtmp-adaptive-bitrate-streaming/

## Step X: Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTMP)
RTMP was originally developed for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet, between a server and a Flash player. It was created by Macromedia (now part of Adobe) and was later released as an open specification that’s commonly used for Flash and Flex/Air applications. The protocol supports AMF, SWF, FLV, and F4V file formats.

Today, most people agree that the video support included within HTML5 will reduce the need for these file formats. However, because there is so much video out there, and much of it is not HTML5-compliant yet, these traditional formats still carry a lot of weight.

Like WebSockets, RTMP creates persistent connections between a server and a client application written in Flash or Flex/Air. The technology is used to reduce the overhead involved in establishing and tearing down connections for low-latency or highly-interactive apps. Also like WebSockets, performance testing for RTMP is typically focused around the optimizing data that’s pushed from the server to the client.

# Auto-Connect to Open WiFi Network
[!open-wifi](http://true-random.com/homepage/projects/wifi/free_wifi.jpg)
I would like this project to auto-connect to any open WiFi network automatically;
Without knowing the SSID beforehand or involving any human intervention.

To have the RPi Zero search and connect to ANY Open Wifi,
modifiy the `/etc/network/interfaces`:

```bash
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet manual

# establish connection to home wifi and other known networks
auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```


See the following `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`
to connect to any open / unsecured wifi in range:

```bash
# country code environment variable, required for RPi 3
country=US

# path to the ctrl_interface socket and the user group
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

# allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite configuration file whenever configuration is changed
update_config=1

# 1 = wpa_supplicant initiates scanning and AP selection ; 0 = driver takes care of scanning
ap_scan=1

# wifi network settings for home network
network={
    id_str="home"              # needs to match keyword you used in the interfaces file
    psk="my-password"          # pre-shared key used in WPA-PSK mode ; 8 to 63 character ASCII passphrase
    ssid="74LL5"               # SSID either as an ASCII string with double quotation or as hex string
    mode=0                     # 0 = managed, 1 = ad-hoc, 2 = access point
    scan_ssid=0                # = 1 scan for hidden SSID ; = 0 scans for visible SSID
    proto=WPA RSN              # list of supported protocals; WPA = WPA ; RSN = WPA2 (also WPA2 is alias for RSN)
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK WPA-EAP   # list of authenticated key management protocols (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, ...)
    pairwise=CCMP              # accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA (CCMP, TKIP, ...)
    auth_alg=OPEN              # authentication algorithms (OPEN, SHARED, LEAP, ...)
    priority=5                 # priority of selecting this network (larger numbers are higher priority)
}

wifi network settings for jetpack
network={
    id_str="jetpack"           # needs to match keyword you used in the interfaces file
    psk="my-password"          # pre-shared key used in WPA-PSK mode ; 8 to 63 character ASCII passphrase
    ssid="Verizon-MiFi6620L-7EE6"      # SSID either as an ASCII string with double quotation or as hex string
    mode=0                     # 0 = managed, 1 = ad-hoc, 2 = access point
    scan_ssid=0                # = 1 scan for hidden SSID ; = 0 scans for visible SSID
    proto=WPA RSN              # list of supported protocals; WPA = WPA ; RSN = WPA2 (also WPA2 is alias for RSN)
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK WPA-EAP   # list of authenticated key management protocols (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, ...)
    pairwise=CCMP              # accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA (CCMP, TKIP, ...)
    auth_alg=OPEN              # authentication algorithms (OPEN, SHARED, LEAP, ...)
    priority=3                 # priority of selecting this network (larger numbers are higher priority)
}

# connect to any open / unsecured wifi in range (must broadcast an SSID)
network={
    id_str="open_wifi"         # needs to match keyword you used in the interfaces file
    ssid=""                    # SSID isn't important, any will do
    mode=0                     # 0 = managed, 1 = ad-hoc, 2 = access point
    key_mgmt=NONE              # network must be open with no security
    priority=-999              # priority of selecting this network (small number means network of last resort)
}
```

Now bring interface down/up and check status.
Execute `sudo ifconfig wlan0 down && sudo ifconfig wlan0 up && sudo wpa_cli -i wlan0 status`
and look for `wpa_state=COMPLETED`.

## Shutdown Button
The Raspberry Pi Zero features two pin holes,
labeled RUN on the board along side the bank of GPIO pins.
You cant shutdown your RPi from these pins but you can do a hard reset
or start your RPi from them.
All you need to do is attach a momentary push button switch to these pins,
and pushing the button will hard reset your RPi or if you have already shut it down,
you can turn it back on with just a press of the button.
You can find documentation on the reset switch for the [RPi Zero][120] or
any of the [Rev 2 RPis][121].
