The "easiest" thing for us to get you for the demo would be our modem and existing dev board, which is an expansion board for the Atmel Xplained Pro:

https://www.digikey.com/catalog/en/partgroup/sam-l21-xplained-pro-evaluation-kit/54571?mpart=ATSAML21-XPRO-B&vendor=150.
This is something we can ship right away. There is a BLE expansion board for this kit, as well as a number of other expansion board options. There is also a BLE-based Xplained board, though we haven't used it before (to my knowledge). It uses a Cortex-M0 based MCU. This would be the closest to what we are actually doing for a dev board, so would likely be easiest for us to support.

There is another board (SAMD20) that has a GPS reference design as well

Conversely we could spin a RPi shield for you. It would be about a day of work, though if it the only option we would be happy to do it. Ideally if you could support T&M for that it would offset some of the extra work since we probably won't be mass-producing the RPi shield for our dev kit (since we like to "force" people into a constrained embedded environment from the get go, rather than Linux, which isn't a great option for low-power devices).

I've copied Ryan Zanski on this who is our hardware lead for our LTE-M module who can answer any follow-up questions you may have or tell me if I've mischaracterized anything.
