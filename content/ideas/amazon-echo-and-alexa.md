# Amazon Echo "How To Do"
## How to access the Amazon Echo from the Web
Even though you need to do the original Echo setup from an iOS or Android app
(mostly so it finds your WiFi network),
you can also access many of the Echo's settings from the web.
Point your browser to [echo.amazon.com](http://echo.amazon.com).

## How to stop the Amazon Echo from listening for its wake word
If you want the device to go completely radio silent and respond to absolutely nothing,
even by accident, there's a mute button on the top of the can.
Press it and a red ring will highlight and Alexa will stay mute until you press the button again.

## How to control the Amazon Echo from a different Amazon account
Let's say your music isn't in your Amazon account
but your entire digitized CD collection is in my wife's account.
So if we want to listen to her collection, or otherwise access her settings,
we need to switch profiles.
To find out what profile you're currently using, say "Alexa, which profile am I using".
To switch profiles, say either "Alexa, switch profile"
and it will move to the next profile or "Alexa,
switch to David's profile" and it will switch to the profile you just named.

## How to get the Amazon Echo to repeat an answer
If you didn't hear the answer to your question quickly enough,
Alexa is happy to repeat it.
Simply say "Alexa, can you repeat that?" and it will.

## How do I find new Alexa features
Just ask, "Alexa, what new features do you have?"
Whenever Amazon adds something new,
they program an explanation into Alexa
and she’ll give you all the details by just asking that question.

## You can make the Amazon Echo read you a Kindle book
you can ask Alexa to read Kindle books in your library. Alexa reads books purchased from the Kindle Store, borrowed from the Kindle Owners' Lending Library or Kindle Unlimited, or shared with you using Family Library.
Just say Alexa, read "[Kindle book title]."

## How to Create a Notification
The classic example of a Notification is one that silently monitors your email address
and alerts you when you have a new email.
Unfortunately, Alexa doesn't support this but [Jasper does](http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/api/notification/).

# Setting Up Your Echo or Echo Dot
Amazon's ["Getting Started with Echo Dot"][01], ["Set Up Your Echo Dot"][02]
["Reset Your Echo Dot"][03]
webpages gives you all the details neede to setting up the Echo Dot.

Since you maybe buying the Echo Dot to control some new devices,
your going to make sure the devices are know by the Echo and
they are grouped for collective control, if desired.
The basic steps are:

1. First, you must discovery any new devices
(Select Main Menu > Smart Home > New Devices).
1. Another key thing to do is to create a group within the Alexa phone app
(Select Main Menu > Smart Home > Your Groups).
In my case, all the bulbs in my Living Room where put in the group "Living Room".

# Managing Alexa
Your can manage your Alexa instance vi the [Alexa smart phone app][09],
or you can use the equivalent [Amazon Alexa web site][10].

# How to Add Skills to Alexa
To add a Skill, start by tapping on the sidebar menu button in the
top-left corner of the screen in the Alexa app
(or the [Amazon Alexa web version][10])
and follow the procedure [here][11].
After you enable the Skill,
you also might be redirected to a new screen where you’ll need to sign into your account
that’s associated with the Skill you installed.
After you do this,
you’ll get a message saying that the Skill has been successfully added and linked.
From there, you can go back to the main screen of the Alexa app.

# AT&T Speech API

</a>
This code was inspired by the [Jasper Project][53]
and [Amazon's Echo][58].
Jasper, an open-source, crowd developed, [Siri-like][54] virtual assistant for Raspberry Pi.
The concept is to have an always-on system constantly waiting for
voice commands that you can hack together to use in your home.
The Jasper Project anticipates contribution form carry out
any kind of automated task you can think of using voice commands,
such as reading you news headlines, sending commands for home automation, etc.

In it's current implementation, Jasper uses a Linux based text-to-speech and speech-to-text package.
It has been [recommended to use a web-based API instead][55],
specifically the [AT&T Speech API][56].

>AT&T will disable access to its Speech API effective October 1, 2016.
AT&T has transferred the rights to the Speech API to Interactions.
Interactions is committed to continue development and innovation using the WATSON Speech engine.

This API is being used by [Jibbigo][57], a smart phone language translation app.
The API is well documented, requires your registration for an API key, but free for limited use.
The main limitation with this free Speech API is its rate limit,
but it's very difficult to run up to the limit for most applications.
You're limited to 1 request per second and your audio file must be less than a minute in length.

Here I'm going to exercise the AT&T Speech API outside of Jasper just to demonstrate its use.
With a little imagination, you should see how it can turn a Raspberry Pi into an
interesting Internet-enabled speech application using this API.

# Implementing Alexa Skills
To implement a Home Skill there are several parts that need to created.
see the text here - https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2016/11/05/alexa-home-skill-for-node-red/

This is a sample skill written in JavaScript that demonstrates how to use device ID and the API endpoint values to make a request to the Alexa Device Address API - https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-node-device-address-api?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTjJabFltSmlaakF6WVRjeCIsInQiOiI4RjZvd3dka25pUU5PRXFnTFVTZ0FhdnNJeEJrWXY4RGdsR1Y5SEJFanFrMEtvZTk0K216UTEzZXJHMng2YlhDVHBDd3dwbmt2NG8ybE4rcE1VWEFEQ1ZQU3hVRUE0eTY5MjdWaWxIcGhPMG5cL0xoNWhPMEZKYXFaWGFBc1JrODMifQ==


# First Alexa Skill (Ask Google)
# Doing Google Search via Alexa
The two leading voice assistants are Amazon’s Alexa and [Google’s Voice Assistant][04].
While Alexa is capable of doing more,
Google’s voice assistant tends to respond to knowledge questions more accurately
with the help of Google’s search engine.
Thanks to an [open source project][05],
it’s now possible to unofficially add Google’s voice assistant to Amazon Echo.
Even comes with a detail [guide on how to install][06] this Alex skill.
We'll start here with Alexa skill creation so we can first focus on the
loading the skill, and leave for later the design of the skill.

When you add “Ask Google” support to Alexa,
you’re adding a voice interface that can read [Google’s knowledge graph][07] answers.
While it’s a very powerful addition, it isn’t exactly the same as [Google’s "Ask Google" service][08].
There is no pre-made Alexa Skill to enable, so you’re going to have to create your own.
While that may sound difficult, the entire process is just a series of copy & paste values
that you need to enter into various forms.

and the Google Assistant is its alternative to Amazon's Alexa.
Google Assistant launched on Google Home and [Google Pixel smartphones][18]
but not (as of this writing) offered on Andriod or other smartphones.
[Google has confirmed it will begin rolling out an Assistant][19]
the week of 26 February 2017 for Android 7.0 Nougat and 6.0 Marshmallow phones.
[To check if your phone has Google Assistant][23], say "Ok Google", "Hey, Google",
or press-and-hold the home button
([but has some problems for Samsung users like myself][21]).

Alexa's abilities, in large part, is based on the skills that you or someone else program into it,
and if the skills are not present, your likely to get the "I don't understand the question" response.
Google Assistant on the other hand has the Google search engine at its disposal,
and therefore, you can ask Assistant almost anything,
and it will understand your words in context and serve up relevant results in a conversational manner.
Google Assistant also has it equivalent to Amazon's Alexa Skills, call [Conversation Actions][24].
Which is better, Amazon Echo with Alexa vs. Google Home with Assistant,
is a subject of much debate (see [here][14], [here][17], [here][25], [here][26], and [here][23]).

One of the nicer things about Google Assistant
is that it is [designed to be conversational][20].
That is, you ask a question and then ask several follow-up questions,
and Google Assistant will be able to keep track of the conversation, determine context,
and audibly respond with the right information.
You do need to preface each with the "OK Google" or "Hey, Google" wake-up.
Like Echo Alexa (see [Alexa dialog history][16]),
Google also allows you to peek at all the data Home sends back and forth
(go to [`myactivity.google.com`][15]).

With Google Assistant on you smartphone,
find stuff while you're traveling,
make phone calls or text messages or email,
open phone apps, and [more][20].
