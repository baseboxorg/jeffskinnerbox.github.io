# Electromyography (EMG)
Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles.
EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph,
to produce a record called an electromyogram.
An electromyograph detects the electrical potential generated by muscle cells
when these cells are electrically or neurologically activated.
