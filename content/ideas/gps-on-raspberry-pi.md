I purchased [Adafruit's GPS Breakout][01] which uses the [MediaTek MTK3339 chipset][02].
This is a high-quality GPS module that can track up to 22 satellites concurrently,
has an module has a standard ceramic patch antenna
with an excellent high-sensitivity receiver (-165 dBm tracking and -145 dBm acquisition!),
and a built in antenna but with a option for active external antenna.
It has a 10Hz update rate (i.e. it can do up to 10 location updates per second)
giving it a high speed, high sensitivity logging or tracking capability.
Its power usage is very low, only 20mA during navigation and 25mA during tracking.
It claims a warm/cold start time of 34 seconds,
a maximum tracking velocity of 515 meters/s,
a position accuracy of 1.8 meters, and velocity accuracy of 0.1 meters/s.
The module supports DGPS/WAAS/EGNOS,
it is FCC E911 compliance with AGPS support,
jammer detection / reduction,
and multi-path detection / compensation.

The module supports an optional CR1220 coin cell to keep the real-time clock (RTC)
running, allowing warm starts and a tiny red LED.
The LED blinks at about 1Hz while it's searching for satellites
and blinks once every 15 seconds when a fix is found to conserve power.
Data is provided via a serial [NMEA 0183][06], 9600 baud (default) output.

The GPS module has a built in data-logging capability.
There is a microcontroller inside the module,
with some empty FLASH memory,
and the firmware allows sending commands to do internal logging to that FLASH.
You simply the microcontroller "Start Logging".
After that message is sent, the microcontroller can go to sleep
and does not need to wake up to talk to the GPS anymore to reduce power consumption.
The time, date, longitude, latitude, and height is logged every 15 seconds
and only when there is a fix.
The internal FLASH can store about 16 hours of data.
It also will automatically append data so you don't have to worry
about losing data if power is lost.
With the current firmware, is not possible to change what is logged and how often.

With the module, I also purchase an external [active GPS antenna][03] that draws about 10mA
and will give you an additional 28 dB of gain
(but it has a 5 meter cable so may not see this gain).
You'll also need a [console cable][04] to easily make use of this GPS module.

Adafruit provides some excellent write-up on how to configure and use this device:

# Get GPS Working on Raspberry Pi

## Step X: GPS Module Pinouts - DONE
[Adafruit's tutorial][05] provides an excellent description of the GPS module pins
and how to connect the console cable and external antenna
can be found in the tutorial "[Adafruit Ultimate GPS on the Raspberry Pi][07]".

[!gps-module-pinout](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/003/713/medium640/raspberry_pi_UltimateGPS_bb.png?1396801027)

## Step: X Setup Console Cable - DONE
Once you plug the console cable into the RPi,
the adapter should show up as a device file `/dev/ttyUSBX`
(where the 'X' will be '0', '1', '2', etc. depending on what other `ttyUSB` adapters are present.
So do the following:

```bash
# before you plug in the console cable
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
ls: cannot access /dev/ttyUSB*: No such file or directory

# after you plug in the console cable
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
/dev/ttyUSB0
```

This shows a new device file `/dev/ttyUSB0`.
This is your serial connection to the GPS module.

With the console cable plugged into the USB port of the RPi and GPS module wired,
you can do a quick check on what the device is doing:

```bash
# quick check of GPS module
$ sudo cat /dev/ttyUSB0
$GPGGA,164440.093,,,,,0,00,,,M,,M,,*71

$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*1E

$GPGSV,1,1,01,01,,,31*7B

$GPRMC,164440.093,V,,,,,0.00,0.00,060180,,,N*4B

$GPVTG,0.00,T,,M,0.00,N,0.00,K,N*32

$GPGGA,164440.093,,,,,0,00,,,M,,M,,*71


```

To monitor continuously, its best to open up a serial terminal to check for activity.
Follow these steps:

```bash
# mointor gps data continously
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600

# "ctrl-A" followed by ":quit" to stop and get out of screen
```

It may 30 or more seconds before the red LED stops blinking at 1 second intervals.
During this time, the GPS module is attempting to get a fix on the GPS satellites.
If needed, [use the external antenna to get a GPS fix][14].
The module will automatically detect an external active antenna is attached and switch over to use it.

>**NOTE:** uFL connectors are small and delicate.
The are not engineered for for repeated connections/disconnections.
Once you attach a uFL adapter, it is best to just let remain on the module.

The raw GPS data being produced are called [NMEA sentences][08].
You'll notice there are a few different kinds of NMEA sentences,
but the most common are ([NMEA Reference Manual][17] or [MTK3339 Data Sheet][02]):

* [$GPRMC - Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data][09]
* [$GPGGA - Global Positioning System Fix Data][10]
* [$GPVTG - Track made good and ground speed][11]
* [$GPGSA - GPS DOP and active satellites][12]
* [$GPGSV - GPS Satellites in view][13]
* [$GPZDA - Date & Time (UTC, day, month, year, and local time zone)][19]

> **NOTE:** NMEA is the abbreviation for the [National Marine Electronics Association][15].
They develop specification that defines the interface between various pieces of marine electronic equipment.
[NMEA sets the standards for data format supported by all GPS manufacturers][16].

## Step X: Installing the GPS Daemon (gpsd) - DONE
The Raspberry Pi is successfully receiving the serial data that the GPS module provides
but its very cryptic.
There is a daemon that properly parsing the raw GPS data called `gpsd`.
It acts as a layer between your applications and the actual GPS hardware,
parsing errors, and providing a more readable, well-defined interfaces to any GPS module.

While a daemon service has its uses, it can get in our way.
Therefore, in this configuration the daemon service will be turned off.

To install `gpsd`:

```bash
# install the daemon gpsd
sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps

# disable the gpsd systemd service
sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl disable gpsd.socket
```

Should you ever want to enable the default `gpsd` systemd service,
do the following (but not now!):

```bash
# enable the default gpsd systemd service
sudo systemctl enable gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl start gpsd.socket
```

## Step X: Using the gpsd Daemon
Now run the following command to manually start `gpsd`:

```bash
# manual start gpsd daemon
sudo gpsd -N -G /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

# to kill this daemon
sudo killall gpsd

# to run gpsd in the foregorund (not as a daemon)
sudo gpsd -G /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
```

The `-G` option allows you to connect from a non-localhost.
For example, via `telnet BlueRPi.local 2947`.
Not needed if you are connecting via terminal or ssh.

```bash
# X displays current GPS position/time/velocity and the locations of accessible satellites
xgps

# speedometer that uses position information from the GPS
xgpsspeed

# cgps is a client resembling xgps, but without the pictorial satellite display running in serial terminal
cgps -s

# collects fixes from gpsd and feeds them to a running instance of Google Earth for live location tracking
gegps

# watches packets coming from a GPS and displays them along with diagnostic information
gpsmon
```
These tools come with the `gpsd` package but don't need the `gpsd` process running to work:

```bash
# this will give you output like 'sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600'
gpscat -s 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0

# gpspipe is a tool to connect to gpsd and output the received sentences to stdout
gpspipe -r /dev/ttyUSB0
```


###############################################################
There is a differnace between the out put of
gpscat -s 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0
and
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600

But gpspipe -r /dev/ttyUSB0 looks like screen


gpscat -p /dev/ttyUSB0
gets you something similar to "screen"

What is the nature of that difference??

## Step X: External Antenna
For information about NMEA sesntance that cover antenna status - https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-ultimate-gps.pdf

## Step X: Using the Python GPS Library
With the `gpsd` process running,
execute the Python program below:

```python
import gps

# Listen on port 2947 (gpsd) of localhost
session = gps.gps("localhost", "2947")
session.stream(gps.WATCH_ENABLE | gps.WATCH_NEWSTYLE)

while True:
    try:
    	report = session.next()
		# Wait for a 'TPV' report and display the current time
		# To see all report data, uncomment the line below
		# print report
        if report['class'] == 'TPV':
            if hasattr(report, 'time'):
                print report.time
    except KeyError:
		pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
		quit()
    except StopIteration:
		session = None
		print "GPSD has terminated"
```

## Step X: Using the Node.js GPS Library
* GPS.js is an extensible parser for NMEA sentences - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gps
* wrapper to start and stop gpsd from your program - https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gpsd
