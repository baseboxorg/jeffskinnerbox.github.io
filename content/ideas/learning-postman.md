I have settled upone [Postman][01] (including other closely related Chrome tools)
and the commandline utility [cURL][03] as my prefered tools for interacting with HTTP based APIs.
There are several tools to choose from, but I have invested my time & efforts into learning these tools.

[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
:   curl is an open source command line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax.
    curl supports a range of common Internet protocols,
    currently including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DAP,
    DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP.

[httpie]()
:   httpie is a command-line http client, much like cURL or wget.
    httpie extends the basic functions of curl or wget with things like
    pretty-printing and syntax-highlighting within your terminal window.
    It recognises a few most-commonly used formats, such as JSON & HTML
    and processes the output accordingly.

[Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/)
:   Create and send any HTTP request, save to history, and replay later using the Postman Builder.
    Manage and organize your APIs with Postman Collections for a more efficient testing and integration workflow.
    Automatically generate API documentation based on your Collections, and publish them to standard formats.

[Postman Interceptor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-interceptor/aicmkgpgakddgnaphhhpliifpcfhicfo/)
:   Postman Interceptor helps you send requests which use browser cookies through the Postman app.
    It can also send headers which are normally restricted by Chrome but are critical for testing APIs.
    The Interceptor makes this process painless.
    Something that would have required a proxy earlier can now be achieved without
    any installation steps or extra configuration.

[Run in Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/docs/run_button)
:  The Run in Postman button opens a collection of API endpoints directly in the user's Postman app.
    You can embed the button in your documentation to link a collection of endpoints
    and workflows that help developers onboard onto your API faster.

[Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman)
:   Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman.
    It allows you to effortlessly run and test a Postman collection directly from the command-line.
    It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it
    with your continuous integration servers and build systems.

[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)
:   The Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring
    and debugging tools built into Google Chrome.
    The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser
    and their web application.
    Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints,
    and get insights for code optimization.
