you to get hands-on experience with AWS Cloud Services.
The AWS Free Tier makes available many sewrvices for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date
(some service do not automatically expire at the end of your 12 month).
You can find more about [AWS pricing here][05].

To get atarted with AWS, first check out the [10-Minute tutorials][08].
Also check out the [getting stated documenttion][09], [videos][10], and [Self-Paced Labs][11].

you can naviated to the the [AWS Console][07].
The AWS Console is a landing page where you can being to establish and access the whole
set of Amazon AWS Services.

# What is AWS IoT Button
AWS IoT Buttons are available for purchase on [Amazon.com][06].

configure the button

* Press and hold the button for five seconds until the LED starts flashing blue.
* Use your phone or computer to connect to the Button ConfigureMe - XXXX WiFi network. Use the last 8 digits of the serial number of your device as the WPA2-PSK password.
* In a browser, navigate to http://192.168.0.1/index.html.
* Select the network (SSID) you want the button to connect to and enter its password.

The button will work wherever there is WiFi (2.4 Ghz).
If it can connect to the Internet, it will work.

The AWS IoT Button message payload contains the device serial number,
the measured battery voltage, and a click type.
The following JSON template shows what is sent in the payload.

```json
{
    "serialNumber": "GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "batteryVoltage": "mV",
    "clickType": "SINGLE | DOUBLE | LONG"
}
```

A LONG clickType is sent if the first press lasts longer than 1.5 seconds.
SINGLE and DOUBLE clickType payloads are sent for short clicks.
The battery should last for approximately 1,000 presses.
When the device battery runs out of charge, there is no way to recharge or replace the battery.

There is a multi-color LED on the AWS IoT Button to provide status:

| Color          | Status       |
|:--------------:|:------------:|
| Blinking White | Connecting to WiFi, getting IP address, connecting to AWS IoT. |
| Solid Green    | Successfully connected to WiFi and published a message to AWS IoT. |
| Blinking Blue  | Soft AP mode. |
| Solid Orange   | No WiFi configured. |
| Red            | Error. (See the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/button/) for more information.) |

# What Is AWS IoT?
AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between IoT devices and the AWS cloud.
This enables you to collect data from multiple devices, store, analyze the data,
and create applications for the data.
These applications enable your users to control these devices from their phones or tablets.
Check out the [AWS IoT Developer Guide][03] to further understand the AWS IoT components and related AWS services.
