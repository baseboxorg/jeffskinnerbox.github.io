Subject: Battery Back Up System For Sump Pump

Hi Jennie,

Here are the links to the company that makes the inverter and one source for
the battery.  You may be forced to buy the battery locally as opposed to
ordering online because most places want a battery core for replacement or
the other thing is that the shipping is very expensive.  Amazon wants
$175.00 shipping.
