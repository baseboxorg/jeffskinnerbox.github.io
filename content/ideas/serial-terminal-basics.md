HyperTerminal - HyperTerminal is the defacto terminal program for any Windows OS up to XP (you can find ports for other Windows versions).
PuTTY
Screen
microcom

Minicom is a terminal program, intended for use with a modem, that
works well as an intermediary to any remote system connect through a
serial port.
One big advantage of minicom is that it allows one to easily capture
text into a file.

Many embedded devices still communicate over a serial connection like they did 40 years ago.
On the other hand, most modern computers lack a hardware serial port,
and replaced with a USB serial interface.
This post shows in detailed steps how to open a serial connection to an embedded device on Windows (Vista, XP), Linux and Mac OS X.

# Serial Port

# What is the Tx and Rx?
TX and RX are abbreviations for Transmit and Receive, respectively. Note that these metrics are referenced to the server being monitored; Transmit FROM this server, and Receive TO this server.

# Terminal
Back when computers where big, bulky, and took up entire rooms,
you would generally interact with them via punch cards and paper tape.
But there was also another device first used by the computer operator,
but later by end users, used for entering and retrieving data, known as a [terminal][01].
These terminals came in many form factors, but generally consisted of a keyboard and a screen.
The earliest terminals were pure electromechanical devices,
[teletypewriters (TeleTYpewriter, TTY)][03] (more generically know as a [teleprinter][02]),
with no electronic logic and no CRT display tube,
just keyboard and paper printer.

In the realm of computers, TTY was used to refer to "teletype" or "teletypewriter",
but it has come to refer to any type of text terminal.

# What is a Console?
The device `/dev/console` is used to send messages to the console.
The console where system messages appear is described as the "logical console",
which can also be the keyboard and monitor that are attached to the system.

# Types of Serial Port
serial port lines (CTS, RTS, DTR, DSR, RI, CD)
## RJ45
## DB-9
## RS-232
