[[Shive Wave Machine|http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2011/3/7/AT&T-Archives-Similarities-of-Wave-Behavior]]
- This mechanical wave generator illustrates wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection and impedance matching.

[[Harmonic Analyzer|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsM30MAHLg]]
- A nineteenth century mechanical computer that performed Fourier analysis by using gears, springs and levers to calculate with sines and cosines.
And of course, someone in the maker community has made a
[[plywood version of the harmonic analyzer|http://hackaday.com/2016/04/11/fourier-machine-mimics-michelson-original-in-plywood/]].

AT&T produced the video "[[Seeing the Digital Future|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avHo0-qU8xo]]" and
brags about things like the Data-Phone which could transmit
at up to a bit-rate of 110 bits per second.

[[Mechanical Computer|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1i-dnAH9Y4]]
- Mathematical computation via mechanical form is discussed for fire control computer aboard Navy Ships.

[[Popular Electronics Magazine|http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Popular-Electronics-Guide.htm]]
- Popular Electronics was created in 1954 by Ziff-Davis Publishing for an audience of  electronics hobbyists and experimenters.
It became Computers & Electronics in November, 1982

[[AmericanRadioHistory.com|http://www.americanradiohistory.com/index.htm]]
- Two million pages of AM FM & TV Broadcasting history online

[[AT&T Tech Channel|http://techchannel.att.com/index.cfm]]
- Originally-produced videos about AT&T's Technical History and the past, present and future of the world of technology.

[[Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS)|http://hackaday.com/2014/12/02/retrotechtacular-ma-bells-advanced-mobile-phone-service-amps/]] - The first-generation cellular technology from AT&T

[[The Boy Electrician|http://www.tayloredge.com/museum/museum/TheBoyElectrician.pdf]] is an introduction to electricity and magnetism from a time when you could still build things at home that worked just like commercial gear.

[[Foxhole Radio|http://bizarrelabs.com/foxhole.htm]]
where built by GI's, during World War Two, which took advantage of readily available materials.

The [[Pascaline|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h71HAJWnVU]]
was the first successful mechanical calculator. It was developed in the 1640's by the mathematician Blaise Pascal.

From the mid-40s until the 90s,
[[Heathkit|http://hackaday.com/2014/12/22/the-heathkit-mystery/]]
was the brand for electronic kits ranging from test equipment, ~HiFis, amateur radio equipment, to computers. Their departure was a tragic loss,
but there are some faint signs they may be making a
[[come back|https://www.heathkit.com/heathkit-faq.html]].

A [[teleprinter|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcMHam54EOI#t=516]]
(teletypewriter, Teletype or TTY) is an electromechanical typewriter that can be used to send and receive typed messages from point to point and point to multipoint over various types of communications channels.
Teleprinters were invented in order to send and receive messages without the need for operators trained in the use of Morse code.
At there core, they were
[[mechanical UARTs|http://hackaday.com/2015/11/13/retrotechtacular-a-mechanical-uart/]],
converting serial bits pumping out at 110 baud and
converting the encoding to letter strikes on the paper.

This training film on [[Basic Telephony|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKfa27PTE_s#t=29]]
(and it's [[part 2|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKvllL2zxGo]])
describes the common household telephone prior to todays digital telephony.

The [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) System|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06drBN8nlWg]],
was designed and built in the 1950s to defend against the threat
of Soviet bombers attacking the continental United States.

The [[UNIX Operating System|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0]]
was developed to make the job of creating software systems easier,
and in general, make the interaction of computers with people easier.
This productivity gain was taken further with the introduction of the
[[Blit|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr1XXvSaVUQ]], an early windowed graphic interface for Unix.

Silicon Valley, or as it was formerlly know,
[[Valley of the Hearts Delight|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley]],
is in some ways retro.
See the article "[[To Invent the Future, You Must Understand the Past|https://medium.com/backchannel/why-silicon-valley-will-continue-to-rule-c0cbb441e22f]]".

Before [[Pong|http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3900/the_history_of_pong_avoid_missing_.php?print=1]],
there was [[Tennis for Two|http://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/10252/The-Past-and-Future-of-Video-Games.aspx]]
at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|http://www.stonybrook.edu/libspecial/videogames/tennis.html]],
the first video game.
Tennis for Two consisted of a 5 inch oscilloscope and
an analog computer to simulate the physics of gravity and elasticity in real time.
And of course, some have updated the analog orginal with a
[[digital replacement|http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2008/resurrecting-tennis-for-two-a-video-game-from-1958/]].

The [[Omega navigational system|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFAemn1pSw]], deployed by the United States Navy, was a network of eight (VLF) transmitter sites spread around the globe using radio frequencies and phase difference calculations to determine global position.

Some believe Westinghouse built the
[[first electric computer|http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/grand_central_computer_video.php#photo-1]]
in 1913 and installed it in the sub-basement of
Grand Central Terminal.

[[Slide Rules|http://hackaday.com/2015/11/05/slide-rules-were-the-original-personal-computers/#more-175364]]
were among the first computing tools
(other than the [[human kind|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer]])
and a simple example of a mechanical analog computer.
For generations of engineers, technicians and scientists,
the slide rule was an essential part of their daily lives.
Until, all of a sudden, it wasn't.
In 1972 Hewlett-Packard
[[HP-35|http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/personalsystems/0023/0023history.html]]
came out with the first handheld electronic calculator.
Practically overnight, the slide rule had become obsolete.

It was on [[HP's version|http://www.hpmuseum.org/]]
of this [[first Desktop Computer|http://hackaday.com/2015/12/08/retrotechtacular-a-desktop-computer-from-1965/]] that sparked my interest in software coding.
Programming it was only slightly better than working in assembly language.

[[Fax|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax]],
or it original version [[radio facsimile|http://hackaday.com/2015/12/22/retrotechtacular-electronic-publishing-in-the-1930s/]],
was introduced in the 1940s.
Fax provided an pre-computer age of transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images).

The Internet has made the accessing of mathematical, physical and chemical data easy.
Back in the day, as in my college years,
I was required to purchase the
[[CRC Handbook of Standard Mathematical Tables|https://www.crcpress.com/CRC-Standard-Mathematical-Tables-and-Formulae-32nd-Edition/Zwillinger/9781439835487]].
As a parting gift for leave for college,
my high school biology teacher gave me
a copy of the 1928 version of the
[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 3rd Edition|http://hackaday.com/2015/12/23/before-google-there-was-the-chemical-rubber-company/]].
I haven't opened these books in a VERY Long time,
not because they don't contain relevant / useful information,
but the [[Internet makes the book searchable|http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/]].

The [[Lunar Excursion Module (LEM)|http://hackaday.com/2016/02/12/cover-your-glass-a-lesson-in-design-trades/]]
carried astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon’s surface.
There had never been anything quite like it,
and engineers had to overcome many challenges to getting it to a working state.

[[Transmission Lines|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9m2w4DgeVk&feature=youtu.be]]
may not really be retrotech,
but not a hot topic these days, and so may not be well understood.
The pace of this old video is a bit slow by today’s standards,
but the quality of the material presented makes it worth the wait. 
In 1956 that the first transatlantic telephone system,
[[Transatlantic Telephone Cable System 1 (TAT-1)|http://hackaday.com/2016/03/18/what-lies-beneath-the-first-transatlantic-communications-cables/]],
is an example of a transmission line.

You would thing that the [[Fax Machine|http://hackaday.com/2016/02/17/faxing-in-1843/]]
couldn't pre-date the telephone, but it appears it does.
